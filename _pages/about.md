Nancy DENG a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/me/) at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), supervised by Prof. [Li Mengying](https://www.li-realab.info/authors/limengying/). My PhD research focuses on quantifying the effects of clouds on the angular and spectral Plane of Array (POA) irradiance using a 3D shortwave Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer Model (MC-RTM) and advanced deep learning techniques. In addition to my primary research, I have contributed to a project aimed at retrieving cloud properties from Fengyun satellite data. My role in this project involved calculating the upwelling radiance at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) using shortwave MC-RTM.

I got my BSc degree in [Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology](https://en.nuist.edu.cn/main.htm), where I embarked on my initial research project: analyzing the impact of various cloud particles on brightness temperature using the CRTM model. I obtained my Master Degree in [NSSC/UCAS](http://english.nssc.cas.cn/) where I researched the Feiyun-3 Series Satellite's GNSS data processing, advised by [Prof. BAI Weihua](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~bwh), where I studied the grid optimization algirithm to control the quality of precessing.

# üìù Research 

- The water radiative transfer model

- Study the angular distribution of POA while considering solar in different relative location with a cumulus cloud, via a shortwave RTM model.

  The python RTM model is developed by Prof. Li.

  I keep on going to update the codes by adding correlated-K method and adding a vertical inhomogenous cloud module.
